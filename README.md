Fraud Analysis Project
📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on fraud detection through transactional data analysis. It applies fundamental data analysis techniques and machine learning models to identify factors associated with fraudulent behavior and to build a predictive system for early fraud detection.

📝 Notebook Contents
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data distribution, identify anomalies, and understand key variables.

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing the dataset if necessary.

Model Building: Experiment with machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Conclusion: Summarize findings and model performance, along with key takeaways.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries
Python 3

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, imblearn
